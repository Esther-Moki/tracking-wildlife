This project happens to be a Wildlife Tracking App,on environmental impact study for the Forest Service where they are considering a proposal from a timber company to clearcut a nearby forest of Douglas Fir.
Before this proposal may be approved, they must complete an environmental impact study.
This Wildlife Tracking App helps rangers to track wildlife by filling in data on forms in the app with details about the animals in the forest like their age,health,the animal type,whether the animal species is 
endangered or not among many others.
